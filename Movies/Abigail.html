                    This was like if a monster movie was mixed with a teen slasher.
                    Instead of a group facing a supernatural serial killer, they face a generic vampire,
                    but the movie does well playing around with those vampire concepts, which I have to give it credit for.
                    It doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes for a fun watch.

                    You might like this movie if you enjoy classic slashers (Friday the 13th, Nighmare on Elm Street, etc) and M3gan.
