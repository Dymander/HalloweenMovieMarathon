                    Disclaimer! This is a found footage movie!
                    In fact, we found this movie while specifically searching for found footage movies.
                    I think the story goes that these people were planning on making a found footage movie already, but then covid hit.
                    So rather than put it off, they decided to make a movie remotely.
                    The biggest issue with this is that being completey on a Zoom call, I don't always believe their reason for filming.
                    You don't normally pick up your laptop and carry it in front of you when you're investigating somthing in your house.
                    I chose to suspend my disbelief because they actually did a great job with the story and the scares, it's a great watch!

                    You might like this movie if you liked Paranormal Activity or Truth or Dare.
