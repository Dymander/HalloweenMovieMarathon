                    Disclaimer! This is a found footage movie!
                    Actually it's more like a mocumentary, which I first thought was a bit of an odd choice for a horror movie.
                    However, as I watched, I found that it held my interest the whole way through.
                    That's not to say it was the most gripping story ever, but it really was worth it for the ending.
                    I don't see myself rewatching it all the time, but I think everyone should see it at least once.

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Fourth Kind, The Blair Witch Project, or the Hell House LLC series.
