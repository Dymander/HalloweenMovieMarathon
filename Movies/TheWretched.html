                    The Wretched is an amazing take on a classic summer vacation movie turned horror.
                    The main character is compelling because he's not a wimp, he takes action when needed and it's kind of a breath of fresh air for the horror genre.
                    The movie has a super interesting monster that constantly has you wondering how it's going to end.
                    This movie went under my radar for too long!

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Uninvited or IT.
