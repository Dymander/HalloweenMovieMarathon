                    If there were ever a film to prove that visuals aren't everything, this would be it.
                    I keep coming back to this movie because it camptures that Halloween/Autumn vibe while still being a hilarious family film.
                    The jokes really stand the test of time and walk the line perfectly for being appropriate for kids and enjoyable for adults.
                    Too often, "family film" is conflated with "made for children." This isn't the case for this movie.
                    The older you get, the more jokes you can find hiding in this movie, hence the name "family film," you can enjoy it at any age!

                    You might like this movie if you liked Coraline or The Witches.
