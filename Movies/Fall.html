                    47 Meters Down walked so Fall could run.
                    This movie was so engaging with such a simple concept.
                    While I love the paranormal, movies like these where the horror comes from a more realistic situation sometimes hit it home.
                    Especially when they play on one of the most common fears anyone has, the fear of heights.
                    I'm personally not afraid of heights, but this movie gripped me with its story anyway.
                    You might not want to watch this if you have a fear of heights.

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Decent or Bodies, Bodies, Bodies.
