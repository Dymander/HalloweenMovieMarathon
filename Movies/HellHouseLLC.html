                    Disclaimer! This is a found footage movie!
                    They're not for everyone but I enjoy them.
                    This one has a great concept; what if a haunted house attraction got set up in an actual haunted house?
                    I think the idea was good, I believed the actors and the obligitory "why are they filming?" answer.
                    However, like most found footage movies, the format is used as a way to hide the low budget.
                    While that remains true here, they still did a great job of making an entertaining film.
                    I think the low budget was most distracting at the end of the movie.
                    I don't find a person wearing a cheap hooded robe scary, I had a similar issue with As Above So Below, another found footage movie.
                    It was strange because the other scary figures in the movie are done really well.
                    The ending is such a critical place to get it right though, which is why it lost some points in the rating for me, but trust me, it's still worth watching.
                    Especially to get the context you need to watch the prequel, which they made years later and was a huge leap up in quality and performance.
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked As Above So Below, Haunt, or Paranormal Activity.
