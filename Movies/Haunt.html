                    Haunt is a great execution of a modern slasher.
                    It's the classic "group of teens/20-somethings vs a serial killer" or in this case, killers.
                    However, this movie drops the supernatural and focuses on what you would acutally have to do in this situation.
                    I don't think that kind of movie always works for horror, but this movie does a great job.
                    I think the haunted house attraction was an awesome setting for this kind of story.
                    I'm kind of surprised I haven't heard of another movie doing this.

                    You might like this movie if you liked Hell House LLC, Thanksgiving, or Escape Room.
