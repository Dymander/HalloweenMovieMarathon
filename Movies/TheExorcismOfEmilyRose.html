                    I love it when a horror movie takes a common setting/concept and puts an unexpected spin on it for the premise.
                    This movie is not about the exorcism, that has already happened and the girl didn't survive it.
                    This movie is about the court case being held against the priest that performed the exorcism and whether or not he is responsible for her death.
                    To take things even further, the prosecutor is religious, while our protaganist, the defending lawyer, is not.
                    It all makes for a super gripping plot where you want to see how this case turns out.
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked The Exorcist or The Possession.
