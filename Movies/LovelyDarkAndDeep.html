                    This movie hits home with one of my favorite, but very underused, setting concept.
                    I love when a character gets lost in a mysterious and dark pocket dimension or otherly world, similar to Stranger Things' upsidedown or the Outer Wilds DLC dream world.
                    Those might be very specific examples, but it's a specific feel and Stranger Things is the biggest piece of media to do something similar.
                    All other movies, shows, or games that do it are smaller and lesser known, but it's a fantastic concept.
                    I know I'm obsessing over that one piece of the movie, but it really is great beyond that, give it a watch!
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked The Night House or The Endless.
