                    This movie had quite a few issues it had to tackle.
                    First off, the majority of the fanbase is young, which is fine, but it really limits what you can do in a horror movie.
                    Second, the "lore" of the games it was based off of is pretty empathetic to the animatronics.
                    They obviously wanted to show that through the movies' story, but the issue is that without context, the games put you the player against the animatronics.
                    In that case, you could see them as the villains of the games.
                    So what do you do? Make them the villains or the heroes?
                    The movie kind of tried to do both and while I wouldn't say they "failed," the result was just a little lackluster.
                    To its credit, it was pretty wholesome and not low budget.
                    It's not scary, but if you enjoy the source material, it's a decently enjoyable movie.
                    I added it to the list because I want to give it another watch.

                    You might like this movie if you liked Willy's Wonderland or Goosebumps.
