                    The Black Phone is almost everything I look for in a Halloween movie.
                    If it had more suspensful scares, I think it would be perfect.
                    As is, I still love it.
                    Crime thriller, paranormal hauntings, psychic abilities, and a surpising amount of good comedy.
                    Somehow this movie ties it all together perfectly and brings it home in the end!
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked Signs, Split, Misery, or Longlegs.
