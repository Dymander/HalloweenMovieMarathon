                    Disclaimer! This is a found footage movie!
                    The creators of the first Hell House LLC went on to make 3 more movies in the same series, this one being the most recent.
                    As far as I can tell, Hell House 2 and 3 are terrible.
                    I watched a little of 2 and the acting was horrible.
                    This prequel, however, is a whole different game.
                    Watching 2 and 3 is not required, since this is a prequel.
                    I would still watch the first, though, so you can see the moments where it ties into the story.
                    This movie was so much better and has an amazing grasp of terrifying the viewer from anticipation.
                    I sincerely think this one is a great movie and far better than the first.
