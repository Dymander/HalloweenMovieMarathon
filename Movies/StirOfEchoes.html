                    Stir of Echoes is an awesome paranormal crime thriller.
                    In nature, it's not very horror in its themes or asthetic, but I still think there's enough there to watch it in the Halloween season.
                    There's a good balance of humor and investigation.
                    It probably won't scare you, but it's an excellent movie nonetheless.

                    You might like this movie if you liked Longlegs or Frequency.
