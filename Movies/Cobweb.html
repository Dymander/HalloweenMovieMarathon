                    I loved how offputting the world was in this movie.
                    The characters are so weird that you don't really know what they're capable of, so it's fun to see all the extreme actions they take.
                    It feels like this was a horror story made for children adapted into an adult horror movie, and personally, I think it works!
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.
