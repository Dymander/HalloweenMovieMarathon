                    This might be the most well-executed slashers I've ever seen.
                    It's silly, it's thrilling, it has everything you want in a slasher and more!
                    My expectations were incredibly low for this movie, but I had a blast watching it.
                    It's fun enough that it has a high rewatch value and it fits the season perfectly (besides being about a November holiday.)
                    I don't mean to overhype it, but seriously give it a watch!

                    You might like this movie if you like classic slashers (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.,) Scream, or Truth or Dare.
