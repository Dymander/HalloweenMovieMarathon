                    Talk to Me was a brilliant mix of many different horror tropes.
                    There are a lot of concepts that you've seen before, but you've never seen a movie use them like this.
                    Just when you think you get how everything works, it pulls the rug out from under you with a twist on its own concept.
                    It's crazy, scary, fun, and thirlling, I had to give it my top spot this year!

                    You might like this movie if you liked Hereditary, The Black Phone, or It Follows.
