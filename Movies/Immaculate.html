                    Obviously inspired by The Omen, but I liked the direction this movie took.
                    In a way, I almost see it as the anti-Omen, like 3/4 of the way through, you'll see why.
                    They chose to be less supernatural and more "belief-driven people going way too far," which I actually liked.
                    This movie is not afraid to make the viewer uncomfortable, but they do it intentially.
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked The Omen, Midsommar, or Rosemary's Baby.
