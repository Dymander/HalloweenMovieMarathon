                    Late Night with the Devil is an interesting cross between found footage and an occultic horror.
                    The idea is that we're watching unreleased footage from a late night show from the 70's.
                    However, some of the footage just doesn't make sense at all for that premise and is shot like we're just watching a regular movie.
                    It's not very distracting though, the story is way too interesting to be bothered by that.
                    <br><br>
                    You might like this movie if you liked The Exorcist or Color Out of Space.
