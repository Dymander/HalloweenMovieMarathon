                    This brilliant horror-themed comedy is always a good watch for the season.
                    All the themes and jokes aged well (pun intended) and the story is so wacky that it's a great popcorn movie, which is usually all I want.
                    I rate it highly because it does well for what it is, a comedy.
                    Don't expect anything deep, it's just casual and fun!

                    You might like this movie if you like 80s comedies or other horror-themed comedies like The Stepford Wives and Little Shop of Horrors.
