                    This movie does a great job of mixing horror into a desperate situation.
                    I really loved the setting of this movie and how it progressed.
                    Some of the scary elements predictably drop off towards the end, but it makes up for it with a solid story and a great ending.
                    Not a movie that has a lot of rewatch value, but definitely worthy of seeing at least once.

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Ritual or Last Night in Soho.
