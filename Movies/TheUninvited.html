                    This movie might not be for everyone, but it resonates with me, I just love it.
                    It's very much a 2000's movie, which wins points from me but probably loses points for most.
                    I think it has a great setting that gives a somewhat summer-vacation or dream-like vibe to everything.
                    I think that ties into the ending, but I was gripped by the story all the way through.

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Wretched or What Lies Beneath.
