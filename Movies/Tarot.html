                    Another movie about a group of 20-somethings fighting a curse.
                    I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I was pleasently surprised!
                    It's got some good monsters, good story, and it's surprisingly funny!
                    It also doesn't follow the exact cookie cutter formula that so many of those movies cling to.
                    I really liked it, I can even see me rewatching it for fun from time to time, which helps improve its rating for me!

                    You might like this movie if you liked Smile or Truth or Dare.
