                    How old does a movie have to be before I can call it a classic?
                    This movie feels like a classic to me and I never get tired of it!
                    This story did a phenominal job at making it's own original monster, the Beldam.
                    It's just a joy to watch everything unfold.

                    You might like this movie if you like stop motion Tim Burton movies like The Nightmare Before Chistmas and Corpse Bride,
                    although this movie is not a musical like those ones.
