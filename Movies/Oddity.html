                    A paranormal twist on a revenge story.
                    Oddity can be a little slow, but it doesn't overstay its welcome.
                    The characters are great and it does a lot with nearly a single setting.
                    Some stuff is a little predictable, but it's a fun watch regardless.

                    You might like this movie if you liked Insidious or Pumpkinhead.
