                    A wonderful crime thriller with supernatural and occultic elements mixed in.
                    This movie likes to play with a lot of fun paranormal conepts.
                    It's one of those "what if law enforcement had to deal with a crime being committed with supernatual means."
                    It's a little weird that there are other movies and shows that do a similar concept, but they're almost always great.
                    The twist they take on this one is that both the good and bad guys have some supernatual powers.
                    I have some gripes with the ending, which lowered my rating of it, but I really did love this one.

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Empty Man, The Outsider TV series, or Stir of Echoes.
