                    So far, this is the closest thing we have to a House of Leaves movie.
                    It doesn't follow that story, really, but some of the more interesting aspects are there.
                    Watching everything unfold makes little sense, until the ending kind of sets everything straight, which I thought was pretty awesome.
                    I personally don't have a strong desire to rewatch it all the time, it's not that kind of movie, but it was still very good.

                    You might like this movie if you liked The Empty Man or the Haunting of Hill House TV series.
