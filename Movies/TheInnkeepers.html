                    Two hotel employees team up to capture some evidence that their hotel is haunted before it shuts down for good.
                    This movie is a bit oddly paced, but it's still a fun time and the characters are really enjoyable.
                    I think it needed just a little more to be there, but I still think it's worth seeing at least once!

                    You might like this movie if you liked Night Shift or The Awakening.
