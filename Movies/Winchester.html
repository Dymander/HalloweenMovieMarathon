                    I was pleasantly surprised with Winchester (be warned, this is a jumpscare movie.)
                    If you're familiar with the Winchester mansion, it's as if they took that local legend, took away the mystery and cranked up the scares.
                    It's a little bit action by the end as well, but it works.
                    If you're into the jumpscare genre, give this one a shot!

                    You might like this movie if you liked Insidious, The Awakening, or Smile.
